## Introduction

The first time attending Edward Tufte's course in San Francisco, it was like looking at art and information. I was instantly hooked on how he can make data so beautiful and transformative in thinking. It was my first time introduced to data visualization, and I was hooked on this alchemy of converting data into a golden nugget of insightful information. Data science was not even a class or a major offered in college in early 2000, and where could I learn? I walked away from the course with his book, The Beautiful Evidence.

A brief description of my educational background,  I had an undergraduate degree with a double major in Biology and Art and a master's degree in Quality Assurance. By profession, I have been a pharmaceutical scientist for over twenty years in developing multiple quality-driven drug processes, from research to product commercialization. Data has been part of my work, and I always wonder if there is another way to analyze it better. 

As a scientist, I have been trained in the scientific method, a systematic approach to acquiring scientific knowledge. The methods start from carefully observing what is observed, forming a question to interpret the observation, researching or gathering on the topic of the area relevant to observation, formulating a hypothesis to explain the observation, and using measurement-based statistical testing to determine to reject or accept the hypothesis. Thus, a conclusion is made from the experimental finding. Then the scientific method was repeated to refine the hypothesis. Over time, multiple experiments were generated, data were analyzed, models were constructed, technical reports were written, and filed away in the quality assurance document center.
 
Several times I would wonder if an experiment performed has a similar finding from a previous one, and I could refine the following experiment. But, I would have difficulty recalling because the data wasn't readily available or even accurately pulling the correct information. What a miserable time for a scientist trying to innovate a new drug treatment! What if I had a magic wand that would readily present the exact information?

Data science has gained wider usage and popularity since 2001 "as a new, interdisciplinary concept, with three aspects: data design, collection, and analysis (Murtagh 2018)"  Finally, I can further pursue my interest in mastering data as a language, statistics as grammar rule, and art as information visualization that feed my continuous curiosity. In 2019, I was admitted to Syracuse University's master's program in Applied Data Science. After three years, I am thankful to have this learning journey with my fellow data scientists and professors while going through a pandemic and pivoting my career. In 2021, I finally hung my white lab coat as a pharmaceutical scientist and created a new role for myself within my organization.
