## Introduction

The first-time attending Edward Tufte's course in San Francisco it was like looking at art and information. I was instantly hooked on how he can make data so beautiful in design, and transformative in thinking. It was my first introduction to data visualization; and I was hooked on this alchemy of converting data into a golden nugget of insightful information. Data science was not even a class, or a major offered in college in early 2000. Where could I learn about this extraordinary emerging discipline that intercepted with multiple professions? I walked away from the course with his book, “The Beautiful Evidence”.

A brief share of my educational background,  I have an undergraduate degree with a double major in Biology and Art and a master's degree in Quality Assurance. By profession, I have been a pharmaceutical scientist for over twenty years - developing multiple quality-driven drug processes, from research to product commercialization. Data has been a longstanding part of my work, and I always wondered if there is another way to analyze it better. 

As a scientist, I have been trained in the scientific method, always seeking and applying a systematic approach to acquiring scientific knowledge. The methods start from carefully observing what is observed, forming a question in how to interpret the observation, researching, or gathering on the topic of the area relevant to observation, formulating a hypothesis to explain the observation, and using measurement-based statistical testing to determine to reject or accept the hypothesis. Thus, a conclusion is made from the experimental finding. Then the scientific method was repeated to refine the hypothesis. Over time, I ensured that multiple experiments were generated, data was analyzed, models were constructed, technical reports were written - then filed away in the quality assurance document center.

Several times I wondered if an experiment performed would have a similar finding from a previous one. Also, I wondered if I could refine the following experiment. But, I would have difficulty recalling this process because the data wasn't readily available or even accurately pulling the correct information. What a challenging time in the scientific pursuit of innovating a new drug treatment! What if I had a magic wand that would readily present the exact information?

Data science has gained wider usage and popularity since 2001 "as a new, interdisciplinary concept, with three aspects: data design, collection, and analysis (Murtagh 2018)"  Finally, I can further pursue my interest in mastering data as a language, statistics as grammar rule, and art as informational visualization to nourish feed my unabated curiosity. In 2019, I was admitted to Syracuse University's master's program in Applied Data Science. After three years, I am thankful to have this learning journey with my fellow data scientists and professors while going through a pandemic and pivoting my career. In 2021, I carefully placed my white lab coat as a pharmaceutical scientist into my closet of professional experience and created a new role for myself within my organization.

## Overview of the Major Practice Areas in Data Science

IST 687, Introduction to Data Science, was the first Syracuse class I took. It introduced the hard and soft skills expected for a data science project (figure 2). The hard skills are retrieving, wrangling, exploring, analyzing, modeling, and validating. Eighty percent of the time spent is in the data wrangling process, and only 20% is spent on exploration. The soft skills are collaborating with the subject matter experts, crafting the business questions, applying creativity, communicating effectively, and presenting the findings. These skills are purposefully designed in all the Syracuse courses, which continuously develop and prepare the student's mindset of a data scientist.
 
The professors of Data Science department have brought their industry/academic experiences to the classes, which gave real-life work scenarios and prepared students for what skills are needed to be a successful data scientist. My primary focus in Data Science is as follows: text analysis (IST 644); data structure (IST 659); and analysis (IST 687, IST 707, IST 718, and IST 772); and visualization (IST 719 and SCM 651). The secondary focus is on data pipelines and platforms track, which focuses on data engineering (IST 652 and IST 769). Various practical areas were taught, such as the followings: 

1.	Pull data from reliable sources and clean and structured data for data exploration.
2.	Perform sentimental analysis in natural language processing to determine whether a phrase is negative, positive, or neutral,
3.	 Build a logical data model, establish a functional database, and refine entities linkages through SQL coding, 
4.	Use Bayesian statistics, logistic regression,  and ANOVA analysis.
5.	Apply Supervised (support vector Machine and Decision tree) and unsupervised ( association rule mining and clustering) machine learnings. 
6.	Work in a team for projects, presentations, and reports.

These learning journeys are presented in the following sections.
